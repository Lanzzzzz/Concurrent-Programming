# Concurrent-Programming

Concurrent programming using Java

* A1: compute the sum of the elements in an array a[N]
  * Iterative parallelism
  * Recursive parallelism
* A2:
   * (Andrews 4.14 on p. 194.) Develop a concurrent implementation of a bounded buffer with multiple producers and multiple consumers such that multiple deposits and multiple fetches can execute at the same time.
   * (Andrews 4.16(b) on p. 195.) one producer process and _n_ consumer processes share a buffer with _b_ slots using Semaphores for synchronization.
* A3:
  * (Andrews 5.6 on p.256 (b) ) Dining Philosophers
  * The unisex bathroom problem
* A4: 
  * (Text 9.12 p. 481). a heartbeat algorithm for finding a network topology.
  * (Text 9.28 (b) p. 486). the locking and update mechanism for a replicated file server using tokens and weighted voting.
* A5:
  * (Andrews 11.26 p. 586). Implement and measure the performance of the shared-variable program for Jacobi iteration.
